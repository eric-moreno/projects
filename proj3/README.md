## Instruction on setting up appropriate software environment for project 3

The project is done in Jupyter Notebooks. It's an interactive IDE that is used in many scientific data anlysis projects! For example, in the annoucement of the lastest muon g-2 measurement, the spokeperson showed how they obtained the final measurement by sharing a video of them running a code cell in jupyter notebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81PfYnpuOPA (at 54:02).
